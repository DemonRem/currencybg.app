<br><br>
Version 2.0 brings you currency exchange rates information from various Bulgarian sources.
The new sources functionality has practical purposes should you want to monitor rates or exchange currencies
and we\'ll be adding more sources in the upcoming versions of the app.
<br><br>
The BNB exchange rates are removed in this version, because we believe they do not bring
any practical meaning concerning currency exchange. You can still find the BNB exchange rates in the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.vexelon.bgrates">BGrates</a> app.
<br><br>
&emsp; - Now displays currency rates from various sources.
<br>
&emsp; - BNB is now excluded, as it does not provide direct exchange services.
<br>
&emsp; - Added a calculator when entering currency values to convert.
